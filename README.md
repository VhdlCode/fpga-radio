FPGA RADIO is an open-source project aimed at teaching you how to build from scratch an embedded system in VHDL that allows you to send radio signals, in one word a software-defined radio.

The teaching approach taken here is to begin from a simple module and gradually progress to a more complex system. It is therefore essential to respect the progression of the learning path traced by this text.

The wiki associated with this project begins with the simplest VHDL module that makes FGPA RADIO LED blink. More complex modules are introduced and built upon previous simpler modules. If you follow the path you will gradually go from nothing to a fully functional radio that you can connect to your PC and start sending signal messages.

In this repository you will find all the source code of FPGA RADIO. All development is based on the [freerangefactory.org Xula2 board](http://www.freerangefactory.org).

Before you jump into this project and if you are not familiar with VHDL, it is a good idea to have a look at the great [Free Range VHDL book](http://www.freerangefactory.org).
